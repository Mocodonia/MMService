# MMService
Mocodonia Map Service, a map for Mocodonia!

## About the project
This project makes Mocodonia have a Google Maps style. See the map as it is from the last snapshot!

## How did we make it
These are all the things the project used.
- Journeymap (for 2d tiles)
- Leaflet.js (to make the map)
- Firebase (for the images and reviews)
- GitHub (for the site itself)

## Progress
The map is now showing the surface, zoom is not possible at the moment, and clicking on cities is in progress maybe

## Tile Updates
The tiles will get updated every few days.
